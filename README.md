# Speedcoin
An altcoin with very fast block times.

# Build
These libraries are already pre-compiled, but they need a bit of modification. First, unzip the zip folder and extract all the files (not only the wallet) to somewhere you can work on it (the Desktop for example). Execute speedcoin-qt.exe and follow the instructions. Next, close the application and move speedcoin.conf to your “%APPDATA%\speedcoin\” folder.

# Mining
To start mining, make sure speedcoin.conf is probably installed into your speedcoin folder in AppData and execute mine.bat to start mining.

# Wallets
The pre-compiled wallet code for both Windows and Linux can be found under the releases. Please not that releases may be updated, so always download the newest one. The executables will be found under each version.

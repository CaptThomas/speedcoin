These libraries are already pre-compiled, but they need a bit of modification. First, unzip the zip folder and extract all the files (not only the wallet) to somewhere you can work on it (the Desktop for example). Execute speedcoin-qt.exe and follow the instructions. Next, close the application and move speedcoin.conf to your “%APPDATA%\speedcoin\” folder.
